BullsAndCows
============
A simple yet interesting two player four letter word game. One player is word maker player, other one is word breaker player.
Word maker player sets a four letter word. Word breaker player starts guessing the word. For each trial, word breaker player gets to know the number of bulls and cows in his guess.
A bull is a correct letter in correct place. A cow is correct letter in incorrect place. Game gets over if the breaker players guesses the correct word (ie., gets 4 bulls)
